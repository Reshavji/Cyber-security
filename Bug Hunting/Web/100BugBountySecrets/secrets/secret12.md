# Subdomain Enumeration Techniques üîÆ

### 1. Certificate Transparency
- Certificate transparency logs all the entries of the issued certificates in an inventory. This includes domain names, sub-domain names, and email addresses. This is publicly available to everyone.
- CT logs search engines:<br>

[https://censys.io/](https://censys.io/)<br>

### 2. Search Engines
The ‚ÄúSite:‚Äù operator which was used to search domain and subdomains was working in the below-mentioned search engines:
- Google
- Bing
- Yahoo
- Yandex
- Duckduckgo
- Aol
<br>&nbsp;

### 3. Online DNS Tools
I found 9 sub-domain enumeration services:

### 4. ASN (Autonomous System Number)
- An autonomous system number is a unique number that is given to an Autonomous system and which is assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
- Online tools to find ASN number:<br>

### 5. Subject Alternate Name (SAN)
- The multi-domain SSL certificate secures up to 250 unique domain names or subdomains and that domain/subdomains names mentioned in the Subject Alternative Names (SAN) field in the certificate.
- Tools to extract domain names from SAN:
OpenSSL<br>
[Python Script](https://github.com/appsecco/the-art-of-subdomain-enumeration/blob/master/san_subdomain_enum.py)<br>
<br>&nbsp;

### 6. Public Dataset (Rapid7)
- Rapid7 performs Internet scanning to collect Internet-wide scan data and then publish the results publicly for free and some data is paid.
- Rapid7 Datasets Link: [https://opendata.rapid7.com/](https://opendata.rapid7.com/)
<br>&nbsp;

### 7. Brute force or Dictionary Attacks
Tools:
- Aquatone
- Bluto-Old
- DNS-Discovery
- Dnssearch
- Knock
- Fierce
- Subbrute
- Amass
- Dnsrecon

### 8. Zone Transfer
- DNS zone transfer is the process of replication DNS database or DNS records from the primary name server to the secondary name server.
- The DNS zone transfer functionality used by an adversary only when the primary name server is configured to replicate the zone information to any server. An adversary acts as a slave and asks the master for a copy of the zone records.

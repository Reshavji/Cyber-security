# Business Logic Bug Worth 600$ ðŸ§©

1. I logged in my account. There was option for refer a friend.
2. I used this URL for new signup with referral link and i activated plan for 15$
3. I received 30$ in my account because i shared my referral link to user for new signup.
4. I logged in new account and submit subscription cancel request and i got back 15$.
5. Again i logged in my account and that 30$ was still there.
6. Repeated this steps 3 times and now i have 90$ without getting paid anything.

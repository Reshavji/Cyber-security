# Found +6 DomXSS at different programs üêâ

1. Collect as much as you can of subdomains of your targets
2. Scan them and see which are alives.
3. I use my [own tool](https://github.com/doosec101/swagger_scanner) to find Swagger Ui endpoints.
4. With the help with swagger nuclei template was able to discover +100 of my targets using Swagger Ui, But +6 of them was vulnerable to DomXSS.

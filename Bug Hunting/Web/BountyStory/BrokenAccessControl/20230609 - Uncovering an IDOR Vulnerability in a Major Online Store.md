# Uncovering an IDOR Vulnerability in a Major Online Store ❄️

1. Locate the unsubscribe link in the email notification for an out-of-stock product. The link follows this format:
```
product-unsubscribe/product_number?delete=user_number
```
2. Notice that the user_number is in ascending order, making it simple to automate the process of unsubscribing all users with tools like Burp Suite’s Intruder.
3. By changing the user_number and product_number values, an attacker can unsubscribe users from email updates for any out-of-stock item.

# How I escalated default credentials to RCE üßØ

1. I came across an application which was using Tomcat.
2. The first thing I did was brute forcing tomcat directories, but unfortunately, it did not work.
3. I tried a couple of more things but it didn‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs where I decided to visit Shodan.
4. I saw some application running on port 8082 and it was using tomcat.
5. I tried accessing http://x.x.x.x:8082/manager and guess what, it was prompting me to enter username and password.
6. BOOM!!!!!, The username=tomcat and password=s3cret worked and the Tomcat Application Manager Console was accessible.
7. I should have stopped but I knew, I can get a remote code execution by uploading malicious war file.
8. I created the WAR file with malicious JSP file.
9. I navigated to ‚ÄúSelect WAR file to upload‚Äù section and uploaded it.
10. The webshell was successfully uploaded and I was able to run a few commands on it.
